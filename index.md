I don't know why I would choose some anime wallpaper as the theme for it, I really don't know...

Bruin's philosophy club is fun

Anthro, or archeology, has many innovative methods that is fundamental to study any things.

The crisis of self-identification let people learn
I am in one of those crisis right now

Inavoidable in human nature, perhaps the chill days are the best days, and the most brillant.

Fantastic backpacking trip for the last weekend. Feels like found my group of people. 
It really turned out to be very hardcore. It was kinda raining, while we were determined to reach a waterfall. We barefooted trailed to a high waterfall sources. It took us around an hour to be there. 

Went to the philosophy club. Normally I would be very active regarding to those topics, today I wasn't really active. Some solitude is just can't be resolved, and maybe finding a emotional and intellectual origince is just epheminal. 

The journey is already worthwhile before I step my feet on the Thailand. The hardest part is to really make sure you are not in danger or getting scammed by a person you never met, and by an organization nobody around you have never came across with. 

Now I am in Moo Baan Dek, kanchanaburi, thailand. Lovely kids, astounding school. beloved teachers, family.

The research field in mech corp give me a feeling of indecisiveness. Anthropic transformer threads and the LessWrong are two great places to get started. A few older papers comes from Distill. There is too much blogs to see, very busy. 

Today I cleaned up a wasted room at the corner of the village, and moved in some old but excellent quality music instruments in. Journey just began.

Plan to focus on a few field during the summer: Computational complexity, topology, and computational neuroscience.

The script is finally working!

Teaching record:
First week was watching movie: Dora the explore, the big red dog, and then combined with a lot of writing on the whiteboard. Writing on the white board can be very fun and engaging. Tell the kids to come up and draw pictures plus the English words, and followed by pasaThai.
There isn’t a topic for us.
Second week was pretty much the same.
Third week I printed out some worksheet about body parts, and then did Simon says, and some songs and dancing. 
I feel like music/culture would be a great topic.
It’s important to note that we are not here to be an ambassador of a very specific culture that we thought would be ahead of everyone else. We are here to promote knowledge and equality of cultures internationally. Thus it’s important for the children to respect their own culture, and then understand other cultures around the world, including Asia, pacific, Eastern, western…
I also made use of many music instruments, drums and harps as they are easy to play. The class is very engaging!

Moo Baan Dek School Management notes and first draft:

The school don’t have any curriculum for common subjects. Each teacher decides on what to teach and design worksheets on a class-to-class basis.

There is no group chat for teachers. Sometimes teachers don’t know the schedule of the school or the events example: one teacher took some kids to see the doctor.

Children rarely read books.

向伟大的人学习
He is the son of Mel Awl. He looks like Gandi, with the glasses on. He showed me the piles of documents about education for children with special need. All the note takings... He truly run the school.
He sits outside with his computer, under the tree. He said he has to work outside even when it’s hot, because he has to see all the kids, and the kids can come to him whenever they like.
村一生
我很少参与种地，但是孩子们每天都做，我起床之前他们已经开始打扫屋子和周围，下午还会去花园以及农田和鸡舍。有些时候他们会在屋子里编制篮子或者做木工，绘画。在这个村子里生活，事实上我很少知道其他孩子在干什么，在哪里，但是什么都不知道也能生活下去。不问就不知，但即使妈妈们也不知道全部。外面我们也从来不会知晓所有事情，但有些事情已经被安排的严丝合缝，有些则是和你毫无关联。不论，我都从来没有被赋予过“知晓”的权利。但在这里，我会察觉到，询问任何事情，允许，不奇。没有网络，没有群聊，虽然我建议过妈妈。我们称呼大人/老师/监护者/职工 “Mel” 意为 “妈妈”。因为他们/她们教课，陪着孩子玩耍，夜晚也孩子们共居在零零散散的木头屋子里。妈妈全天，全周都在村子里，孩子们也是。大家有些时候会出去，看医生，参加活动，或者单纯游玩。但最近的县城开车也要半小时。全国每天中午都有捐赠团队带着他们的饭菜，物资进来，这就是这个村庄/学校：หมู่บ้านเด็ก “Moo Baan Dek” 赖以运营的一部分。每个人有一个大碗和一个勺子叉子，我也是。我们就用这个打饭，吃完之后洗干净碗筷。村里的事务分配的井井有条，食堂以洗碗池小孩子都一块打扫。吃剩的饭菜倒在一个桶里，要么被狗打翻吃净了，要么拿去decompose. 我写作之时大家都去上课了，我恰巧有空。这也是一天中最凉，最安静的时间，院子里没有孩子。

每周五村子里做“parliament meeting”，是一种利用民主投票和讨论来解决纠纷的模拟法庭。在那个村子中心很凉快的大厅下面，有一个人笔录，后面有五六个孩子做“jury”，台下是其他人。大家会讨论一周所有的纠纷。这次说的是在村子里骑自行车的责任问题。一个孩子骑别人的自行车摔伤了。很多人支持骑车，其他人阐述了不同的观点。最后我们决定挂一个意见箱，通过写作来交流。一周后回来，我看到了一群孩子，围在那个袋子面前。当然大大小小的纠纷讨论了好久，不少孩子已经睡着了。

每天和孩子们说晚安，拜拜。总是看书，时常思考，偶尔写作。这周下雨，凉快，但是很潮湿，蚊子也多了。
燃烧生命

平静的在温凉的夜晚燃烧，稍微喝一点酒，享受夜晚，长大的权力

坐在橙色的车厢里，之后就是在鲜艳颜色的玻璃海洋里漂流。闷热难耐，偶尔的风吹过。空气混杂着木柴，青草，重视有炎热的风。
