Bruin's philosophy club is fun



Anthro, or archeology, has many innovative methods that is fundamental to study any things.



The crisis of self-identification let people learn
I am in one of those crisis right now

Inavoidable in human nature, perhaps the chill days are the best days, and the most brillant.

Fantastic backpacking trip for the last weekend. Feels like found my group of people. 
It really turned out to be very hardcore. It was kinda raining, while we were determined to reach a waterfall. We barefooted trailed to a high waterfall sources. It took us around an hour to be there. 

Went to the philosophy club. Normally I would be very active regarding to those topics, today I wasn't really active. Some solitude is just can't be resolved, and maybe finding a emotional and intellectual origince is just epheminal. 

The journey is already worthwhile before I step my feet on the Thailand. The hardest part is to really make sure you are not in danger or getting scammed by a person you never met, and by an organization nobody around you have never came across with. 

Now I am in Moo Baan Dek, kanchanaburi, thailand. Lovely kids, astounding school. beloved teachers, family.

The research field in mech corp give me a feeling of indecisiveness. Anthropic transformer threads and the LessWrong are two great places to get started. A few older papers comes from Distill. There is too much blogs to see, very busy. 

Today I cleaned up a wasted room at the corner of the village, and moved in some old but excellent quality music instruments in. Journey just began.

Plan to focus on a few field during the summer: Computational complexity, topology, and computational neuroscience.
