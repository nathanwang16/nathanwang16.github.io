I don't know why I would choose some anime wallpaper as the theme for it, I really don't know...

Bruin's philosophy club is fun



Anthro, or archeology, has many innovative methods that is fundamental to study any things.



The crisis of self-identification let people learn
I am in one of those crisis right now

Inavoidable in human nature, perhaps the chill days are the best days, and the most brillant.

Fantastic backpacking trip for the last weekend. Feels like found my group of people. 
It really turned out to be very hardcore. It was kinda raining, while we were determined to reach a waterfall. We barefooted trailed to a high waterfall sources. It took us around an hour to be there. 

Went to the philosophy club. Normally I would be very active regarding to those topics, today I wasn't really active. Some solitude is just can't be resolved, and maybe finding a emotional and intellectual origince is just epheminal. 

The journey is already worthwhile before I step my feet on the Thailand. The hardest part is to really make sure you are not in danger or getting scammed by a person you never met, and by an organization nobody around you have never came across with. 

Now I am in Moo Baan Dek, kanchanaburi, thailand. Lovely kids, astounding school. beloved teachers, family.

The research field in mech corp give me a feeling of indecisiveness. Anthropic transformer threads and the LessWrong are two great places to get started. A few older papers comes from Distill. There is too much blogs to see, very busy. 

Today I cleaned up a wasted room at the corner of the village, and moved in some old but excellent quality music instruments in. Journey just began.

Plan to focus on a few field during the summer: Computational complexity, topology, and computational neuroscience.

The script is finally working!

Teaching record:
First week was watching movie: Dora the explore, the big red dog, and then combined with a lot of writing on the whiteboard. Writing on the white board can be very fun and engaging. Tell the kids to come up and draw pictures plus the English words, and followed by pasaThai.
There isn’t a topic for us.
Second week was pretty much the same.
Third week I printed out some worksheet about body parts, and then did Simon says, and some songs and dancing. 
I feel like music/culture would be a great topic.
It’s important to note that we are not here to be an ambassador of a very specific culture that we thought would be ahead of everyone else. We are here to promote knowledge and equality of cultures internationally. Thus it’s important for the children to respect their own culture, and then understand other cultures around the world, including Asia, pacific, Eastern, western…
I also made use of many music instruments, drums and harps as they are easy to play. The class is very engaging!

Moo Baan Dek School Management notes and first draft:

The school don’t have any curriculum for common subjects. Each teacher decides on what to teach and design worksheets on a class-to-class basis.

There is no group chat for teachers. Sometimes teachers don’t know the schedule of the school or the events example: one teacher took some kids to see the doctor.

Children rarely read books.

向伟大的人学习
He was the son of Mel Awl. He looks like Gandi, with the glasses on. 
燃烧生命

平静的在温凉的夜晚燃烧，稍微喝一点酒，享受夜晚，长大的权力

坐在橙色的车厢里，之后就是在鲜艳颜色的玻璃海洋里漂流。闷热难耐，偶尔的风吹过。空气混杂着木柴，青草，就是那股炎热的风。
